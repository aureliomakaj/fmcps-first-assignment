TITLE: Just some notes about the project.


NuSMV modules that will be used:
- init : contains all the functions needed to initialize and close NuSMV. These functions need to be used before any other access to PyNuSMV
- glob : provides functionalities to read and build a model from an SMV source file
- fsm  : contains all the FSM-related structures like BDD-represented FSM, BDD-represented transition relation, 
         BDD encoding and symbols table (except for method reachable_states)
- prop : defines structures related to propositions of a model; this includes CTL specifications
- dd   : provides BDD-related structures like generic BDD, lists of BDDs and BDD-represented states, input values and cubes


INIT MODULE: 
 - init_nusmv : Initialize NuSMV. To be called once before using any other function of pynusmv.
 - deinit_nusmv : Quit NuSMV. To be called once after using pynusmv. 


GLOB MODULE:
Provide some functions to access global NuSMV functionalities. These functions are used to feed an SMV model to NuSMV 
and build the different structures representing the model, like flattening the model, building its BDD encoding and getting the BDD-encoded FSM.
