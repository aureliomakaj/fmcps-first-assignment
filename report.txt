REPORT FOR ASSIGNMENT 1
"""
        By going backward from a state A, we find all the states from where A is reached. 
        But this is not enough because we can find states that are not encountered 
        starting from one of the initial state. 
        Thus, at each step we intersect the region of the pre-operation with the region
        of the post-operation, to obtain the states that start from an initial state and 
        goes into A.
